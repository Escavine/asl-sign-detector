# asl-sign-detector
This is for the software development for my A-level Computer Science project, it utilises a pre-trained neural network known as SSD-Mobile Net which takes in the manually collected and labelled images for training and testing via transfer learning. It also allows for testing in real-time and represents 8 different ASL symbols accurately.
